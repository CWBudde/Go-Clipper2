## M0 ‚Äî Polish the Foundation (Quick Wins) üèóÔ∏è

**Goal: Establish a solid, validated foundation with proper CI/CD**

### Tasks

- [x] Validate module path & imports (fix README placeholder paths in code
      snippets)
- [x] Define stable public API surface in `port/` (ensure all types, enums,
      error values are complete)
- [x] Ensure every API function has:
  - [x] Pure Go stub returning `ErrNotImplemented` in `port/impl_pure.go`
  - [x] Oracle implementation behind `//go:build clipper_cgo` in
        `port/impl_oracle_cgo.go`
  - [x] Table-driven tests that run in oracle mode and skip (not fail) in pure
        mode
- [x] Set up CI pipeline for Linux/macOS testing both build tags
- [x] Verify README examples compile with real import path

**Done When:** CI green on Linux/macOS for both build tags; README examples
compile with the real import path; all API functions have proper stubs and
oracle implementations.

## M3 ‚Äî Pure Go Boolean Operations (Scanline + Active Edge List) ‚úÇÔ∏è

**Goal: Implement complete boolean operations using proven algorithm structure**

### Tasks

- [ ] Port upstream algorithm structure:
  - [ ] Event queue (local minima detection)
  - [ ] Active edge list management
  - [ ] Intersection ordering and processing
  - [ ] Output polygon builder
- [ ] Implement all fill rules correctly:
  - [ ] EvenOdd (odd-numbered sub-regions)

## CGO Integration Challenges

During implementation of the CGO oracle bindings (`capi/clipper_cgo.go`),
several significant technical challenges were encountered that future developers
should be aware of:

### Challenge 1: C++ Library Installation and Linking

**Issue**: The system has Clipper2 headers installed
(`/usr/local/include/clipper2/`) but no corresponding shared/static libraries
for linking.

**Evidence**:

- Headers exist and compile correctly
- Linker fails with "undefined reference" errors for `BooleanOp64`,
  `InflatePaths64`, etc.
- `ldconfig -p | grep clipper` shows wrong libraries (crystallography tools, not
  Clipper2)

**Root Cause**: Clipper2 appears to be header-only or the library installation
is incomplete.

**Resolution Needed**: Either:

1. Properly build/install Clipper2 with shared libraries (`libClipper2.so`)
2. Use header-only approach by including full implementation in wrapper
3. Build Clipper2 as static library and link appropriately

### Challenge 2: C++ Namespace and Type Issues

**Issue**: Clipper2 uses C++ namespaces (`Clipper2Lib::`) and complex type
system that CGO cannot handle directly.

**Evidence**: Compilation errors about `CPaths64`, `CRect64` not being
recognized when declared outside namespace.

**Approach Taken**: Created C++ wrapper file (`clipper_wrapper.cpp`) with
`extern "C"` functions to bridge C++ API to C-compatible interface.

**Challenges Encountered**:

- Type system complexity (templates, namespaces, references)
- Header inclusion issues (some headers have internal compilation errors)
- Memory management differences between C++ and Go

### Challenge 3: Header-Only Implementation Complexity

**Issue**: Clipper2's export functions are implemented inline in headers, making
it difficult to create clean forward declarations.

**Evidence**: Functions like `BooleanOp64` are fully implemented in
`clipper.export.h` rather than being library symbols.

**Implications**:

- Cannot simply declare extern functions - need full implementation
- Must include problematic headers (which have their own compilation issues)
- Complex build chain with multiple C++ standards and dependencies

### Challenge 4: Data Structure Conversion

**Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

- `packPaths64()`: Converts Go `Paths64` to Clipper2 `CPaths64` format
- `unpackPaths64()`: Converts Clipper2 results back to Go format
- Format: `[arraylen, pathcount, [pathlen, 0, x1,y1, x2,y2, ...], ...]`

**Testing**: Ready for validation once linking issues are resolved.

### Current Workaround

The CGO wrapper implementation is structured but returns `ErrNotImplemented` due
to linking issues. The following components are ready:

1. ‚úÖ Data conversion functions (pack/unpack)
2. ‚úÖ Go function signatures matching C++ API
3. ‚úÖ C++ wrapper skeleton (`clipper_wrapper.cpp`)
4. ‚ùå Actual C++ library linking and compilation

### Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Prioritize Library Installation**: Ensure Clipper2 is properly
   built/installed with shared libraries before attempting CGO integration

2. **Alternative Approach**: Consider using Clipper2 as a git submodule and
   building it as part of the Go build process

3. **Testing Strategy**: The pack/unpack functions can be tested independently
   once basic CGO compilation works

4. **Build System**: May need custom build script or Makefile to handle C++
   compilation complexity

This documents the current state so future developers don't repeat the same
investigation and can focus on the specific linking/installation issues.

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach

1. **Milestone-Driven**: Complete each milestone fully before proceeding
2. **Oracle Validation**: Continuously compare against CGO reference
3. **Test-First**: Write property-based tests before implementation
4. **Performance Aware**: Profile and optimize at each milestone

### Build System

- **Default Mode**: Pure Go implementation (`port/impl_pure.go`)
- **Oracle Mode**: CGO validation (`port/impl_oracle_cgo.go` with
  `-tags=clipper_cgo`)
- **Continuous Integration**: Both modes tested on every commit

### Testing Philosophy

- **Property-Based**: Random inputs validated against oracle
- **Fuzz Testing**: Edge cases and numerical stability
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 99%+ match rate with documented exceptions
- **Performance**: Benchmarked against reference implementation

### Numerical Precision

- **128-bit Intermediate Math**: Prevent overflow in calculations
- **Acceptable Tolerances**: Document precision limitations
- **Edge Case Handling**: Graceful degradation for degenerate inputs
