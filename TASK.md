# Go Clipper2 Implementation Milestones

This document outlines the milestone-based implementation plan for porting Clipper2 to pure Go with validated results against the CGO oracle.

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Project structure and build system established
- ‚úÖ CGO oracle bindings implemented for validation
- ‚úÖ Basic utility functions (Area64, IsPositive64, Reverse64) 
- ‚úÖ Rectangle clipping (RectClip64) fully implemented with comprehensive tests and fuzz validation
- ‚è≥ Core boolean operations are stub implementations returning `ErrNotImplemented`

---

## M0 ‚Äî Polish the Foundation (Quick Wins) üèóÔ∏è
**Goal: Establish a solid, validated foundation with proper CI/CD**

### Tasks
- [x] Validate module path & imports (fix README placeholder paths in code snippets)
- [x] Define stable public API surface in `port/` (ensure all types, enums, error values are complete)
- [x] Ensure every API function has:
  - [x] Pure Go stub returning `ErrNotImplemented` in `port/impl_pure.go`
  - [x] Oracle implementation behind `//go:build clipper_cgo` in `port/impl_oracle_cgo.go`
  - [x] Table-driven tests that run in oracle mode and skip (not fail) in pure mode
- [x] Set up CI pipeline for Linux/macOS testing both build tags
- [x] Verify README examples compile with real import path

**Done When:** CI green on Linux/macOS for both build tags; README examples compile with the real import path; all API functions have proper stubs and oracle implementations.

## M1 ‚Äî Pure Go Rectangle Clipping (Sutherland-Hodgman) üìê
**Goal: Implement first complete algorithm as proof-of-concept**

### Tasks
- [x] Research and implement Sutherland-Hodgman clipping algorithm for `RectClip64`
- [x] Handle both closed and open paths correctly
- [x] Add edge case handling (degenerate rectangles, empty inputs, etc.)
- [x] Implement property-based tests comparing pure vs. oracle across:
  - [x] Random rectangles and random paths
  - [x] Edge cases (points on boundaries, fully inside/outside)
- [x] Document any degenerate cases where results intentionally differ
- [x] Implement native Go fuzz test (Go 1.18+ `FuzzXxx` functions) to achieve ‚â•99% match rate between pure Go and CGO oracle implementations

**Done When:** Pure and oracle results match for ‚â•99% of fuzz cases; remaining cases are documented as acceptable degenerates; `RectClip64` is production-ready.

## M2 ‚Äî Core Geometry Kernel & Robust Integer Math üîß
**Goal: Build bulletproof mathematical foundation for all operations**

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement robust 128-bit intermediate math using `math/bits` for:
  - [ ] Cross products without overflow
  - [ ] Area accumulations
  - [ ] Distance calculations
- [ ] Add robust segment intersection detection:
  - [ ] Handle collinear overlaps correctly
  - [ ] Manage floating-point edge cases
  - [ ] Include parallel and near-parallel segments
- [ ] Implement winding number and point-in-polygon tests consistent with Clipper2's fill rules
- [ ] Create comprehensive geometry kernel test suite covering:
  - [ ] Parallel/collinear/degenerate cases
  - [ ] Numerical edge cases near overflow
  - [ ] All fill rule behaviors

**Done When:** Kernel unit tests cover all tricky parallel/collinear/degenerate cases; fuzz tests pass; numerical stability validated across range of inputs.

## M3 ‚Äî Pure Go Boolean Operations (Scanline + Active Edge List) ‚úÇÔ∏è
**Goal: Implement complete boolean operations using proven algorithm structure**

### Tasks
- [ ] Port upstream algorithm structure:
  - [ ] Event queue (local minima detection)
  - [ ] Active edge list management
  - [ ] Intersection ordering and processing
  - [ ] Output polygon builder
- [ ] Implement all fill rules correctly:
  - [ ] EvenOdd (odd-numbered sub-regions)
  - [ ] NonZero (non-zero winding sub-regions)
  - [ ] Positive (positive winding sub-regions)  
  - [ ] Negative (negative winding sub-regions)
- [ ] Start with simple cases (disjoint/overlapping rectangles) then generalize to:
  - [ ] Complex polygons with holes
  - [ ] Self-intersecting polygons
  - [ ] Open paths (lines)
- [ ] Extensive validation against oracle implementation

**Done When:** Pure vs. oracle parity across large randomized test suite; boolean operations produce identical path counts and nearly identical point sets (allowing tiny tolerance on point ordering).

---

## M4 ‚Äî Pure Go Offsetting (ClipperOffset) üìè
**Goal: Complete polygon offsetting with all join and end types**

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement core offsetting algorithm for both expansion and contraction
- [ ] Add all join types:
  - [ ] Round joins with configurable arc approximation
  - [ ] Miter joins with miter limit control
  - [ ] Square joins for sharp corners
- [ ] Support all end types for closed and open paths:
  - [ ] ClosedPolygon and ClosedLine
  - [ ] OpenSquare, OpenRound, OpenButt end caps
- [ ] Implement precision controls:
  - [ ] MiterLimit for controlling spike length
  - [ ] ArcTolerance for round approximation quality
- [ ] Validate against oracle across grid of:
  - [ ] Various deltas (positive and negative)
  - [ ] All join type combinations
  - [ ] Noisy inputs with self-intersections

**Done When:** Parity vs. oracle across comprehensive test matrix; miter spikes properly controlled; round arcs stable with configurable tolerance; all join/end type combinations working.

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
1. **Milestone-Driven**: Complete each milestone fully before proceeding
2. **Oracle Validation**: Continuously compare against CGO reference
3. **Test-First**: Write property-based tests before implementation
4. **Performance Aware**: Profile and optimize at each milestone

### Build System
- **Default Mode**: Pure Go implementation (`port/impl_pure.go`)
- **Oracle Mode**: CGO validation (`port/impl_oracle_cgo.go` with `-tags=clipper_cgo`)
- **Continuous Integration**: Both modes tested on every commit

### Testing Philosophy
- **Property-Based**: Random inputs validated against oracle
- **Fuzz Testing**: Edge cases and numerical stability
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 99%+ match rate with documented exceptions
- **Performance**: Benchmarked against reference implementation

### Numerical Precision
- **128-bit Intermediate Math**: Prevent overflow in calculations
- **Acceptable Tolerances**: Document precision limitations
- **Edge Case Handling**: Graceful degradation for degenerate inputs
