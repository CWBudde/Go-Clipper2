## Development Workflow

### Build and Test Commands

```bash
# Pure Go mode (default)
just build          # Build all packages
just test           # Run all tests
just test-port      # Test only port package
just dev            # Format + lint + test

# CGO Oracle mode (validation)
just build-oracle   # Build with CGO
just test-oracle    # Test with oracle validation
just test-capi      # Test only CGO bindings
just dev-oracle     # Full dev workflow with oracle

# Specific tests
just test-run TestIntersect64Basic           # Pure Go
just test-run-oracle TestIntersect64Basic    # With oracle

# Code quality
just fmt            # Format code
just lint           # Run linters
just lint-fix       # Auto-fix lint issues
```

### Testing Philosophy

1. **Test with Oracle First**
   - Write test case
   - Verify it passes with `-tags=clipper_cgo`
   - Oracle provides ground truth

2. **Implement Pure Go**
   - Implement algorithm in `port/impl_pure.go`
   - Test should pass without `-tags=clipper_cgo`
   - Results should match oracle exactly

3. **Property-Based Testing**
   - Random inputs validated against oracle
   - Fuzz testing for edge cases
   - Target: ‚â•99% match rate

4. **Debug Discrepancies**
   - Use oracle output as expected result
   - Add detailed logging to pure Go implementation
   - Compare step-by-step with reference C++ code

---

## Implementation Strategy

**M4: Offsetting (4-6 weeks)**

- Study reference implementation in `clipper.offset.cpp`
- Start with simple expansion/contraction
- Add join types incrementally
- Validate each step against oracle

**M5: Completeness (2-3 weeks)**

- Straightforward utility functions
- API cleanup and documentation
- No complex algorithms

**M6: Production Polish (3-4 weeks)**

- Performance profiling and optimization
- Comprehensive documentation
- CI/CD hardening
- Release preparation

**Estimated Timeline:** 3-5 months to v1.0.0 (assuming part-time development)

## Notes for Developers

### CGO Oracle is Production-Ready ‚úÖ

If you need Clipper2 functionality in Go **right now** and don't mind the C++ dependency:

- Use `-tags=clipper_cgo` when building
- All operations work correctly (11/11 tests passing)
- Performance is excellent (native C++ speed)
- Fully tested and validated

The pure Go implementation is still in development primarily for:

- Zero-dependency deployments
- Cross-compilation simplicity
- WebAssembly support
- Educational/research purposes

### Debugging Pure Go Boolean Operations

The Vatti algorithm implementation exists but has bugs. To help debug:

1. **Enable logging** in `vatti_engine.go` (add print statements)
2. **Start simple** - use 2 overlapping rectangles as test case
3. **Compare with reference** - `third_party/clipper2/CPP/Clipper2Lib/src/clipper.engine.cpp`
4. **Check intermediate steps**:
   - Are local minima detected correctly?
   - Is the active edge list managed properly?
   - Are intersections calculated correctly?
   - Are output points generated correctly?
   - Is polygon linking working?

5. **Oracle is always right** - if pure Go differs from oracle, pure Go is wrong
