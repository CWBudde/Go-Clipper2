## Issues Identified

### 1. Positive Fill Rule Bug (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Test:** TestIntersectDifferentFillRules/Positive
**Issue:** Returns empty result when it should return the intersection square
**Root Cause:** Likely issue in `isContributingEdge()` with winding count comparison for Positive fill rule

**Details:**
- Subject: CCW square (0,0) to (10,10) - winding = -1 (negative because CCW)
- Clip: CCW square (5,5) to (15,15) - winding = -1
- For intersection: need both subject AND clip filled
- Positive rule: windCnt > 0 (but we have negative winding!)

**Fix:** The issue is that CCW polygons have negative winding. Positive fill rule should work with |windCnt| > 0 or we need to fix winding direction.

### 2. Duplicate Points in Output
**Test:** TestIntersectTriangles
**Issue:** Output has `{5 0} {5 0}` - same point twice
**Root Cause:** Edge intersection point being added twice or degenerate edge handling

### 3. Multiple Regions Merged
**Test:** TestIntersectMultipleRegions
**Issue:** Two separate intersection regions merged into single polygon
**Expected:** `[{0 2} {5 2} {5 3} {0 3}]` and `[{10 2} {15 2} {15 3} {10 3}]` (2 polygons)
**Actual:** Single polygon with all 8 points
**Root Cause:** Current implementation uses single shared OutRec for all intersections

### 4. Self-Intersecting Polygons
**Test:** TestIntersectSelfIntersecting
**Issue:** Only generates 2 output points, then discards (need ≥3 for valid polygon)
**Root Cause:** Figure-8 creates complex edge crossings that current simple algorithm doesn't handle

### 5. Sloped Edge Intersections
**Test:** TestIntersectConcavePolygon, TestIntersectManyVertices
**Issue:** Polygons with non-axis-aligned edges produce empty results
**Root Cause:** Edge swapping and intersection detection failing for sloped edges
**Evidence:** Debug logs show edges swapping out of order

### 6. Polygon with Hole
**Test:** TestIntersectWithHole
**Issue:** Output geometry is incorrect
**Expected:** Intersection minus hole region
**Actual:** Malformed 6-point polygon
**Root Cause:** Opposite winding not properly handled

## Working Cases

✅ Simple rectangular intersections (axis-aligned)
✅ Complete containment (one inside other)
✅ No overlap cases
✅ Thin slivers
✅ Large coordinates (numerical stability good)
✅ EvenOdd, NonZero, Negative fill rules

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Positive Fill Rule
Simple bug fix in winding count handling. Should address absolute value of winding.

### Priority 2: Fix Multiple Region Handling
Current approach uses single OutRec for all intersections. Need proper edge pairing to create separate polygons.

### Priority 3: Improve Edge Intersection Handling
- Fix edge swapping logic for sloped edges
- Prevent duplicate points at intersections
- Handle degenerate cases

### Priority 4: Self-Intersecting Polygon Support
Complex case - may require significant algorithm enhancement or separate handling.

## Next Steps

1. Fix Positive fill rule winding bug
2. Add proper edge pairing for multiple output regions
3. Debug and fix edge intersection/swapping for sloped edges
4. Add more robust polygon building logic
5. Consider comparing with C++ reference implementation for complex cases
